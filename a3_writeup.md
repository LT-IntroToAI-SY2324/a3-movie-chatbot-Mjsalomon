# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
The search_pa_list function compares the inputed query and tries to match to a source query. Then if possible it correctly matches them together.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
Spider Man No Way Home. Made in 2021. I like the movie so i added.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
Director by year. Personally I would like to see the movies per year so then I can more easily compare them for the time period they were made in. Depending on the year a movie is made in, quality differs. Plus it's inresting to see who is in what movies and if people are in multiple movies, you can then see what both of those years are.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would probably make a chatbot for music. i would create it because myself and definitly a lot of other people love to listen to music during differnt times of the day and they would want to search up music. it would be something like this chatbot but ask for genere of music, writer, year made, album and more.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
All of it. i was just kept on getting confused over and over again but after being explained why everything is by my peers it really helped me start to understand what was happening.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action? Yes.
